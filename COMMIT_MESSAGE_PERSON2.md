- POST /contauth/score - Calculate risk score
- GET /contauth/decision - Get authentication decision
- GET /health - Health check
- GET /metrics - Prometheus metrics

### ML Orchestrator
- ✅ Model registry with version control
- ✅ Rollback capability (atomic swap, < 1s)
- ✅ A/B testing framework with statistical analysis
- ✅ Persistent storage with checksums
- ✅ Metadata tracking (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- ✅ Traffic splitting (0-100% configurable)
- ✅ Sticky sessions (consistent hashing)
- ✅ Winner detection with confidence scoring

**Key Files Added:**
- services/ml-orchestrator/model_registry.go (NEW) - Version management
- services/ml-orchestrator/ab_test_manager.go (NEW) - A/B testing framework

**Features:**
- Register/promote/rollback models
- Export/import for backup/transfer
- Safe deletion (protects current/previous)
- Confusion matrix tracking (TP, FP, TN, FN)

## 🔒 Security Compliance

### Enforced Constraints (P0):
- ❌ NEVER execute untrusted code outside sandbox
- ❌ NEVER store raw biometric data
- ❌ NEVER skip threat analysis
- ❌ NEVER expose ML model internals
- ❌ NEVER allow sandbox execution > 30s

- ✅ ALWAYS isolate sandbox execution
- ✅ ALWAYS timeout after 30 seconds
- ✅ ALWAYS hash sensitive data before storage
- ✅ ALWAYS encrypt telemetry at rest
- ✅ ALWAYS mask PII in logs
- ✅ ALWAYS validate input
- ✅ ALWAYS rate limit public endpoints
- ✅ ALWAYS audit security events

### Compliance:
- GDPR: Privacy-preserving feature extraction
- CCPA: No raw biometric storage
- SOC 2: Audit logging, encryption at-rest
- ISO 27001: Access controls, rate limiting
