## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: CUDA Out of Memory
```python
# Solution: Use smaller batch size or gradient accumulation
batch_size = 32  # Try 16 or 8
accumulation_steps = 4

for i, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
    loss = model(data, target)
    loss = loss / accumulation_steps
    loss.backward()
    
    if (i + 1) % accumulation_steps == 0:
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```

### Issue 2: Slow Training
```python
# Solution: Use mixed precision training
from torch.cuda.amp import autocast, GradScaler

scaler = GradScaler()

for data, target in train_loader:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    
    with autocast():
        output = model(data)
        loss = criterion(output, target)
    
    scaler.scale(loss).backward()
    scaler.step(optimizer)
    scaler.update()
```

### Issue 3: Model Overfitting
```python
# Solutions:
# 1. Add dropout
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(128, 64),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.5),  # Add dropout
    nn.Linear(64, 10)
)

# 2. L2 regularization
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, weight_decay=1e-4)

# 3. Early stopping
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(patience=10, verbose=True)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Start Small, Iterate Fast
```
Don't try to implement everything at once.
Start with one algorithm, make it work, then move to the next.
```

### 2. Test Continuously
```
Write tests BEFORE implementing features (TDD).
Run tests after every change.
Use CI/CD to catch issues early.
```

### 3. Document as You Go
```
Write docstrings for all functions.
Add inline comments for complex logic.
Update README.md with new features.
Create architecture diagrams.
```

### 4. Measure Everything
```
Add metrics for every component.
Track performance over time.
Compare against baselines.
Set up alerts for regressions.
```

### 5. Collaborate & Review
```
Do pair programming for complex features.
Request code reviews early and often.
Share learnings in team meetings.
Maintain a knowledge base.
```
