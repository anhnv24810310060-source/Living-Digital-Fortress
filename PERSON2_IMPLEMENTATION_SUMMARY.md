## 🐛 Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations:
1. **Transformer Model**: Weights chưa pre-trained (cần training data từ production)
2. **Federated Learning**: Byzantine detection là heuristic (có thể improve với formal verification)
3. **Performance**: Benchmarks chưa chạy (cần load testing môi trường)

### Improvement Opportunities:
1. **Transformer**: Add caching layer cho repeated sequences
2. **Federated**: Implement secure enclaves (Intel SGX) cho aggregation
3. **ContAuth**: Add WebAuthn/FIDO2 support
4. **Guardian**: Integrate hardware-assisted security (Intel TXT, TPM 2.0)
