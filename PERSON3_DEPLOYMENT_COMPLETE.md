## 🎯 Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Optimistic Locking with Exponential Backoff
```
Formula: delay = baseDelay * 2^attempt + jitter
Range: 10ms → 2s
Max retries: 5
Jitter: ±20% random
```

### 2. Thompson Sampling (Bayesian A/B Testing)
```
For each variant:
  θ ~ Beta(α, β)
  where α = successes + 1
        β = failures + 1

Select: argmax(θ)
```

### 3. Monte Carlo Simulation
```
For i = 1 to 10,000:
  For each variant j:
    sample[j] ~ Beta(α[j], β[j])
  winner = argmax(sample)
  count[winner]++

P(variant is best) = count / 10,000
```

### 4. Cryptographic Audit Chain
```
current_hash = SHA256(
  transaction_id || 
  previous_hash || 
  timestamp
)

signature = HMAC-SHA256(current_hash, secret_key)
```

### 5. Load Balancing Strategies
- Round Robin: O(n)
- Least Connections: O(n)  
- Weighted Random: O(n)
- Response Time: O(n)
