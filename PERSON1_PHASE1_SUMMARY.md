## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### On-Call Runbook

**Phase 1 Component Failures**:

1. **PQC Operations Failing**:
   - Check logs: `grep -i pqc /var/log/orchestrator.log`
   - Verify key rotation: `curl localhost:8080/health | jq .phase1.pqc_rotations`
   - Fallback: Set `PHASE1_ENABLE_PQC=false` temporarily

2. **CT Monitoring Down**:
   - Check CT log connectivity: `curl https://ct.googleapis.com/logs/argon2024/ct/v1/get-sth`
   - Verify webhook: `curl -X POST $PHASE1_CT_WEBHOOK -d '{"test":true}'`
   - Non-critical: Can run without CT monitoring

3. **GraphQL Queries Blocked**:
   - Check complexity: Add `X-Debug: true` header to see complexity score
   - Temporarily increase limit: `PHASE1_GRAPHQL_MAX_COMPLEXITY=2000`
   - Whitelist query: `curl -X POST localhost:8080/admin/graphql/whitelist -d '{"query":"..."}'`

4. **High Anomaly Rate**:
   - Normal during attacks - monitor alert volume
   - Adjust threshold: `PHASE1_ANOMALY_THRESHOLD=4.0` (higher = less sensitive)
   - Increase baseline window: `PHASE1_BEHAVIOR_WINDOW=200`

### Monitoring Alerts Configured

| Alert | Threshold | Severity | Action |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|
| PQC rotation failures | 2 consecutive | Critical | Page on-call |
| CT alerts > 10/hour | 10 alerts | High | Investigate certificates |
| GraphQL block rate > 50% | 50% blocked | Medium | Review query patterns |
| Behavioral anomalies > 100/min | 100 anomalies | Medium | Check for attack |
| Health ratio < 30% | 30% healthy | Critical | Scale up backends |
